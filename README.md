# VerySimpleMemoryGame
Simple memory game developed in multiple mobile technologies.

This game is very simple and there are not many features. It has the best time and best moves number.

Point is not the game itself but showing the possibility of using different technologies to get the goal.

I have the intention to make this classic and simple game using:

- Java DONE
- Kotlin DONE
- Cordova DONE
- React Native
- Flutter
